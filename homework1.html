        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> My name is Guillermo Hernandez, I've been in the US from five years ago. I consider my personality 
            as a friendly, honest and easy going person. I'm very ambitious and passionate about my goals. It makes me happy 
            to be learning all the time about technology, because I think is the way I can grow as a professional to beat my limits 
            related with developing skills. I love to spend time with friends, have fun, drink wine and talk about 
            our lives. I think is important to be around special people.
            I like sports like basketball, tennis and soccer. Finally I love the Chinesse and philippine food.
            </p>

        <h3>My background in the web development field</h3>
        <p>To learn about web development has been one of my goals in my life, even though I have background in software development, 
           coding with different programming langauges, it's my first time developing with html and css. It's one of the reasons why 
           I am very excited about this class, because I have the opportunity to combine different technologies like html and css in 
            order to design professional web sites.
