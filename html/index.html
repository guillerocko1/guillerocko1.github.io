          <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="my picture" class="center" /> <br />Hi
          everyone, my name is Guillermo. I am from San Francisco bay area. I
          consider myself as passioned about software and web development.<br /><br />
          Web development tools are powerful to develop interactive and
          professional websites, and it is why I'm getting this kind of
          knowledge to increase the probabilities to get what I'm looking for,
          one of my career objetives is to build a career as front end web
          developer. Learning new skills is one of the most important things we
          can do. <br />Due to my background with Java, Oracle and MySQL, I have
          found very interesting how powerful is to work with
          HTML/CSS/JavaScript, AJAX, etc, to solve problems through websites and
          apps.<br /><br />
          My goal is to explain to you hard to understand topics in a simple fun
          and friendly way. I love to read and listen to music and podcast in my
          free time. I like to workout, running, futbol soccer and basketball.
          Somethig that is very important for me is to keep a healthy mentality
          to face all the challenge in my personal and professional life, it's
          why a love to read books about biographies. There is a person that I
          admire a lot, Jim Rohn, who has one of my favorite quotes: "Discipline
          is the bridge between goals and accomplishment".
