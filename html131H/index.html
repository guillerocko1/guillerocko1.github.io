    <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. <br> 
      It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), <br> 
      which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.
      <br><br>
      With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements,  <br> 
      how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are  <br> 
      to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!</p>

      <h3>Using CSS</h3>
      <p>
        The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial <br>
        we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.<br> 
        An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.  
        <br><br>
        As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, <br>
        laid out, etc. A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, <br>
        but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
